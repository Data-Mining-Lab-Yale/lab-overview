# Data Mining Lab @ Yale

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **Data Mining Lab**, led by **Dr. Samah Jarad Fodeh** at the Yale School of Medicine.  
Our lab develops innovative methodologies to address challenging problems in healthcare and biomedical informatics.

## 🔬 Research Focus

The lab's current research centers on the analysis of exceedingly large datasets, particularly in the following domains:

- **Text mining**, **information retrieval**, and **information extraction**
- **Machine learning** and **deep learning** for clinical and social data
- **Multimodal data fusion** for prediction and clustering tasks
- **Sparse and non-negative representation** of high-dimensional data

We focus on uncovering **latent low-dimensional structures** in big data to improve representation, interpretability, and algorithmic performance.
